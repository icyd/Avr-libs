 * Implementation of circular buffer with variable array size.
 * The use of power of 2 for the buffer size, will produce a smaller code's size.
 * \warning to use this library is necessary to define the size of the buffer to create 'RING_BUFFER_SIZE', recommended method is to define it with option -D of the compiler.
