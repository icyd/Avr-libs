## Circular buffer with variable size

Implementation of circular buffer in C.

To use it compile it with option -D of gcc: `gcc -D B_SIZE=(desired buffer size)`

By defaults the element stored by the buffer are of type `uint8_t`, but it can be changed to other type using the definition `gcc -D DATATYPE=(data type desired)`

The maximun length of the buffer is 2^16 = 65536
