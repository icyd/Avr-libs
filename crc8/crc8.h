 *
 * Library to calculate crc8 using initial value and mask, as parameter. All functions will work with pointer to the input data, so arrays can be given.
 * Could be use with dynamically given masks and initial values, or with constants. In important to take into consideration that if muliple masks are required trough the program, the dynamic version is the best suited (overall the bitwise). But if only one mask will be required, the smaller code generated is with the table version, with a constant lookup table.
 *
 * To compile the static versions of the function please define MASK and INITVALUE with option -D of the gcc compiler, or with defines.
