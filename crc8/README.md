## Library to calculate crc8

This library is design to realize calculation of crc8 (with diferent initial values and masks) over a variable size array of data.

The value of the initial seed to the crc calculation and the mask value, could be predefined if only one value will be used (through compiler's options `-DCRC8_INIT=init` and `-DCRC8_MASK=mask`). Both definitions have to be given to use those methods.

__Documentation:__ to generate documentation of the source code use `doxygen doxygen.conf`.
